Dendron helps you create links between notes. These links help you organically discover relationships and build out your knowledge graph.

### Linking to notes
To create a link, start typing `[[` and Dendron will show you a list of notes in your workspace that you can link to. 

For Example: [[dendron.remote_vault]]

`[[dendron.remote_vault]]`

### Linking to Headers
You can also not to headers of a note. In the folling example i also changed the test the link is showing in the Preview.

For example [[Header in the Dendron tutorial explaining about linking notes|tutorial#create-a-link]]
