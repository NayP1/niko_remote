A remote vault is not saved on your local drive but on the internet, e.g. GitHub.

To setup a remote vault you need a GitHub account.

Once you have that you can convert your local vault to remote vault.

An explanation is in the **[Dendron Wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6682fca0-65ed-402c-8634-94cd51463cc4/#convert-vault)**
