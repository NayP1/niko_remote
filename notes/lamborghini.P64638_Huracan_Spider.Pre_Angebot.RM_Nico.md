Rückmeldung von Nico:

Hi all, 

here the answers and clarifications from Lamborghini from yesterday

- the Huracan is an hybrid car.
- the spider is with an ```hardtop and without```, also not only without Roof.
- We will have an active hood, similar to the Huracan-> they don’t plan ped pro, the front is identical to the hurican
- we have 2 seats versions, but the same R points and Sitzverstellfeld.
- Front Restraint system is complete carry over.
- ```the huracan has a curtain```, the spider will get only 1 airbag in the seat -> Head thorax airbag-> most of the work
- OOP has to be done 
- Only 1 RHS System for everywhere, maybe Knee nag for NAR
- 2 stearing columns but the same movement
- the weight will be different, but they don’t know how much
- Belt anchorage point a little bit different -> 20mm, they are expecting no modification of the results, but the tests have to be redone 
- SOP in 2026, China Side Barrier has to be done 
- we are doing a ```test phase Proto and then direct homologation```
- Simulation on ```our own clusters, Dummies as we want```, ATD or Humanetics, they don’t care
- I panel Design the same as for the Huracan-> but Probably we have to ```redo the 201 Low```
- probably reinforcement in the door and in the A Pillar
- ```not clear, if there is a 201 Up on the hardtop```


Probably we still have other questions, but I think that we can start to evaluate.

Be careful, Project is for the moment quite small, because of the fact that CSI doesn’t want to have the lead and they are listed as Supplier by Lambo, and we are not.
And we will probably not be able to be on the supplier list in this short time.
But of course we do our calculation independently of this information.
I think that we have big chances to come on the supplier list and to be requested in the next years for the new projects.

The team of Lambo is really small, and ```they are externalizing all the passive safety work```.
If we have the possibility to give our offer, some rounds with Lambo will come in order to refine the quotation

Timeline and Carry over are there.
