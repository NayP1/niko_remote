### Topics:
- Travelcosts and stuff to be calculated like you think. When it is too high, that is ok.
  - Price not so important. Number of test important
  - Understand what you calculate. We need to show Lamborghini that we know what we do
  - Split costs of tests. So one column CSI, one column ARRK
- Why FMVSS201 lower
  - Resecure due to the change in the firewall
  - Firewall has no impact
  - No design change in the I-panel
  - **So no development expected?**
- How to output your calculation
  - In 20_Kalkulation: `\\pzs\dfs\project\cp\_b\P646xx\P64638\20_Kostenkalkulation`
  - Lambo_CostEstimation
  - Row 36-40
- Front will be identical
  - No PedPro
  - A-Pillar reinforcement has no impact on PedPro because A-pillar is red anyways
- Lots of work for side crash expected
- Two different seats. Sitzverstellfeld und Sitzreferenzpunkt gleich
- Only one steering column tested
- Lamborghini doesn't know whether they have to do 201u for the hard top?
  - Curtain airbag missing
  - Geometry of headliner changed?
- Who else works on it?
  - ItalDesgin, CSI, Igiada?
- Dummys not coming from Lamborghini, we can do what we want.
  - FMVSS201u impactor? Buy or not to buy.
  - Should use impactor from Audi? (My opinion)
- If loadcase is missing, do two pricings. After LAH and with additional loadcase you think thats necessary
- Will not be development intensive. Lots of carry over. Do the minimum.
  - One Proto and then homologation
  - Important that we show the technical background and be efficient. 
  - We can do more, but don't expect that Lamborghini will like that
  - Exception of China MDB, because Huracan is coming one year ealier with old regulation
- China homologation. Thor is a maybe, do calculation twice with a maybe?
  -  Huracan coming 2025, so will use old law.
- 2nd Excel also needs to be filled
  - When calculating tests, know why the number, for what you want to have those tests
- We will get the model. Modifications will be as low as possible
  - Hardtop will need to be modelled?
- We are expecting only a small change in the pulse. 
- Change of the mass is not clear at the moment
- FMVSS226 will not be done? Because it is carbio.
- Rear impact
  - Some modifications in the rear
  - If you are not sure, plan something
