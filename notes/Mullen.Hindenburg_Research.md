**[Mullen Automotive: Yet Another Fast Talking EV Hustle](https://hindenburgresearch.com/mullen/)** (April 2022)

- Mullen is an aspiring EV manufacturer that came public in late 2021 via reverse merger. It has yet to produce a sellable vehicle.
- Despite only spending ~$3 million in R&D in 2021, Mullen claims its solid-state battery technology is on track for commercialization in 18 to 24 months, putting it head of every major technology and automaker in the industry who have collectively invested billions on solving the problem.
- In 2020, Mullen announced a joint venture to manufacture its sold-state battery technology. We spoke with a senior executive familiar with the supposed JV who told us “It didn’t exist at all”. It was an apparent fabrication. He called Mullen CEO David Michery “fast talking” and a “hustler”.
- Mullen’s battery claims were based on technology licensed from a 1-year-old Chinese battery technology company. After hyping the importance of the relationship, Mullen made one payment under the deal and promptly terminated the relationship. The Chinese company’s website no longer works.
- Recently, Mullen shocked the market by claiming it would begin manufacturing 2 models of electric vans within months for an unnamed “major, major Fortune 500 customer”. The news sent its stock up ~35% intraday.
- The 2 electric cargo vans that Mullen claims it will be manufacturing are actually Chinese EVs rebranded with a Mullen logo. Import records show the company recently imported 2 vehicles from China, one of each model.
- Mullen has other major production hurdles. The company has no EPA certificates for its vans (nor any vehicle), a requirement to sell vehicles in the U.S. that often takes 12-18 months. It has only a handful of job openings for its plant, and hasn’t begun significant hiring, according to the President of the Tunica County Chamber of Commerce.
- In 2019, the Mullen DragonFly was revealed as a supercar built by Chinese manufacturer Qiantu Motors and was meant to be rebranded and sold by Mullen starting in 2020. Following the reveal, Mullen immediately defaulted on its payment obligations to Qiantu, leading to termination of the agreement in October 2019.
- Mullen continued to market the vehicle as its own. In legal documents, Qiantu alleges this is “an inexcusable misuse of Qiantu’s own intellectual property”. Despite the termination of the agreement, Mullen to this day still says the DragonFly is “Coming Soon” on its website and is soliciting $1,000 reservations for the vehicle.
- Mullen’s Founder, Chairman and CEO, David Michery led 5 failed penny stock companies prior to Mullen. Two had their securities registrations revoked by the SEC, two terminated their securities registrations, and the last one merged with a speculative gold mining company.
- Michery lists no educational background in his Mullen biography. Contrary to other top electric vehicle executives that have engineering and manufacturing backgrounds, Michery’s past work experience was largely in the entertainment industry.
- **We have seen this story before, but Mullen strikes us as one of the worst. With echoes of Nikola, Lordstown, Kandi and Ideanomics, we think Mullen is just the latest in a long line of EV hustles.**
